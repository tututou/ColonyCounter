# ColonyCounter

ColonyCounter is a web application that uses OpenCV to count the number of yeast colonies in images of petri dishes.

## New Developers:

Hi, welcome to the project! ColonyCounter makes use of `django-rest-framework` and `AngularJS`. These are separated into two directories,  `Back-End/` and `Front-End/` (respectively). 

To become acquainted with the front end portion of the project, please checkout the `README.md` in the `Front-End/` directory, and likewise for the back end of the project. Each README aims to help you install the project and give advice on how to approach adding new features.

## Special Thanks:

A special shoutout to Quentin Geissmann, whos open source research and development of the [OpenCFU algorithm](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054072) has taught us so much about computer vision and image processing.
